                                    <p>The setup for this lab required that I install the needed Artemis libraries and that the examples 
                                        ran as expected. In order for the examples to work I had to raise the baud rate to 115200.</p>

                                            it worked as expected.

                                        <p> The next example tested that serial communication was working with a simple echo program, which
                                            returned the inputs as expected.

                                        <p> This example tested the temperature reading on the board. As the video demonstrates, the example
                                            runs as expected - the temperature reading increases from about 32400 to 33000 when held in my warm
                                            hands, and decreases back to about 32400 when blown on.

                                        <p> In this example the test worked on the microphone in the chip. It again gave the expected results and the 
                                            frequency reading increased when I wistled and was otherwise reading 0 besides occasional background noise.

                                        <p>To begin we needed to make a python virtual environment and get Jupyter lab working.
                                            I experienced a lot of issues with python configurations and with getting Jupyter lab to work.
                                            The solution ended up being moving the location of my python instillations, deleting the older versions,
                                            and running the Jupyter lab command with the `--no-browser` option to prevent it from crashing. Once this was
                                            done and the codebase was downloaded, I could check that it had worked successfully by running burning the 
                                            sketch onto the board and observing the MAC address being printed out.
                                        </p>
                                        <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/lab1/mac_broadcast.jpg" />
                                        <p>The codebase uses a UUID and the MAC address of the board to facilitate connection between the board and laptop.
                                            They are used as identifiers so the board and computer know they are connecting to the correct device.
                                            The base makes use of BLECharacteristics to send messages (strings) between the board and laptop.
                                        </p>
                                    </div>

                                        <h3>Lab Tasks</h3>
                                        <div>
                                            <h4 class="text-start">Configurations</h4>
                                            <p>The configuration required that I generate a new UUID, so my devices could identify each other among 
                                                all the other devices searching for bluetooth connection. So I generated a new one and, in connections.yaml,
                                                updated the ble_service field to be the new uuid as well as the artemis_address to be the MAC address that was 
                                                displayed earlier. I also had to change line 53 in base_ble.py from if AT_LEAST_MAC_OS_12, to if True, in order for things to
                                                run correctly.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>I implemented the echo command as was recommended in the handout, so the board responds with "Robot says -> [input] :)"
                                                Because the requirements are very similar to the PING command, I used that as a framework and edited the strings that were appended. 
                                            </p>

                                            <p>This command required more to implement because it is not a command that exists yet. To make it a valid command it needed to be added
                                                to the CMD enum in cmd_types.py, and the CommandTypes enum in ble_arduino.ble, and as a case in handle_command function also in ble_arduino.

                                                Here I was to create a notification handler which would be called whenever a message was received from the board. This is the final form of 
                                                my handler that handles all the commands from this lab. It will store temperature and time readings in ther own lists as well as storing
                                                a log of each message received in a list, and it prints each message as it receives it.

                                                This task called for me to have the board send as many messages as it could in, what I decided was, 5 seconds. To accomplish that
                                                I assigned the sending loop to a command called SAMPLE_TIME. The process for adding this command was the same as for GET_TIME_MILLIS 
                                                and the function was a loop of that command.
                                            </p>
                                            <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/lab1/Screenshot 2024-02-06 at 3.18.41 AM.png"/>
                                            <p>
                                                As the image above shows, the board sent 634 messages in the 5 seconds it was running, meaning it has a transfer rate of about .126 floats per millisecond,
                                                or .504 Bytes per second.

                                                In this task the board takes some number of time readings (I chose 100), and sends them all at once instead of as they are recorded.
                                                This command SEND_TIME_DATA required a global list, and even though the measurements are all taken before any are sent, they must 
                                                still be sent one by one because the BLECharacteristics places a cap on the size of string that we can send.

                                                As can be seen in the screenshot above, the total time elapsed while the 100 measurements were taken was only 2 milliseconds, meaning it recorded
                                                at least 50 times per millisecond. So it is obvious that sending measurements as they are taken significantly decreases how often a measurement can be taken,
                                                so if the focus is on taking as many measurements as possible, say for analyzing what happened while the board is running, then it is better to send data in batches
                                                so you have as detailed of a dataset as possible.

                                                To complete this task, taking a temperature measurement for each of the time measurements in the above section, another new 
                                                command was needed to store and send this data called GET_TEMP_READINGS.

                                            <p> As you can see in the picture below, the function seems to be working as intended, but it taking the extra temperature measurement
                                                does significantly slow the rate of measurements being taken. In the second screenshot you can see that the total time elapsed for 
                                                100 time and 100 temperature measurements is ~6400 milliseconds.

                                                As mentioned in the last part of the All at Once Efficiency section, sending data in batches allows for a much higher data recording rate. As mentioned 
                                                above, the batching method allows for around 200 bytes per millisecond to be sent, way more than the .5 bytes gotten sending each individual measurement.
                                                In this sense it seems like there isn't a reason to be sending measurements as you take them. It is more efficient to take a group of measurements 
                                                and send them all at once. The amount of data that you allow to build up before sending probably depends on the application you need the data for.
                                                Like the example I gave earlier, if you are simply doing logging, it is fine to only occasionally send data so that your logs have very precise data,
                                                but if you need the measurements for calculations critical to the application running, sending in small-medium batches is probably the best way to go.
                                                Assuming the data rate of purely recording the time (200 bytes per millisecond), it would take a bit under 2 seconds to fill the board's 384kB of RAM.

                                            I got these measurements by rotating the board on its edge on the table. The data seems to be pretty accurate although quite noisy,
                                            so below is the same data passed through a low pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 10 Hz. It does a good job of mitigating the
                                            noise as well as muting any shakes from my hand.

                                        during these measurements so the drag is very clear, but there is little range in the measurements so they are precise, although
                                        not accurate. Below those is data from me rotating about each axis sequentially from -90 -> 90º and it takes seemingly precise
                                        and steady readings.

                                        I implemented a complementary filter with an alpha value of .3. I chose that number to mitigate the noise from the accelerometer.
                                        Below is a screenshot of the pitch recordings from the gyroscope and from the complement filter. They follow the same trends but the 
                                        complement is more responsive to quick changes and does not suffer from the drag of the gyroscope.

                                    <p>
                                        After moving sampling to the main loop and removing print statements, I was able to record new IMU data every 2-10ms. I believe it fluctuated
                                        that much because 2ms (.5 kHz), is about the max rate of the IMU's accelerometer and gyroscope data collection. This sampling is too quick though
                                        and would only serve to fill the artemis' storage too quickly. The average sampling rate came out to about 3ms.

                                    <p> So while sending at this rate the artemis can store and send up to 1500 datapoints in about 5 seconds.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        After playing with the robot for a bit I found that it is a shockingly quick car. It can turn on a dime at any point, if done 
                                        while moving quickly it makes the car roll over. Similarly it drives at the same speed forward or backwards, and swapping 
                                        between them quickly makes it flip over. One thing I'll need to be careful about is how instantaneous it changes direction. 
                                        It happens fast enough that there is a loss of grip on the wheels, and as mentioned it is prone to flipping and rolling.

                                        We will be connecting two identical Time of Flight sensors, which means they have the same I2C address, 0x52. To use both 
                                        simultaneously requires using the XSHUT pin to change the address of one of the sensors. I will be placing the sensors on 
                                        the front and back end of the robot. Since from my understanding our robot will be acting in static settings, it will not 
                                        need to worry about an obstacle coming from the side, which will be its blindspot. The 180º separation of the cameras will
                                        make it easier to swap between driving the robot forwards and backwards. Below is a diagram of how I connected the sensors 
                                        to the Artemis board.

                                        Above is the final product of connecting the first sensor to the Artemis and scanning for it. The address printed is 82, which is 0x52 in decimal. 
                                        This means I will need to choose an address other than 82 for the other sensor to use. In choosing the distance mode, I decided to test the short 
                                        range. It is more accurate than the long range mode, and less prone to setting noise. However, I believe for stunts that require the robot to drive 
                                        forward at a high speed, the short range will not see far enough ahead for the robot to react. In the mean time I have tested the short range mode 
                                        by gathering 50 readings at .3, .6, .9, and 1.2 meters and averaging them. Below is a graph that compares the measured and actual distances.

                                        The graph shows the readings deviating more as the distance gets further. I believe some of this is likely due to error in my measurements of the 
                                        actual distance. In the screenshot on the right it shows the variance of each measurement set in mm. It shows that the sensors are very precise, if
                                        a little inaccurate at the edge of its range.

                                        To use both sensors at once, one sensor must receive a low signal to its XSHUT port. This will cause it to ignore what is on the I2C bus
                                        even if it is addressed to it. Then the other sensor must have its address changed, and the XSHUT can be returned to high, and the sensor
                                        will receive I2C communications normally.

                                        Above is my first attempt at gathering readings as quickly as possible along with the code that was being executed. A new datapoint 
                                        was being recorded about every 100ms. I thought this was being slowed by all the Serial.prints, so I changed it so that it would only print time 
                                        when a new point was available, but this resulted in a more consistent 100ms, not a faster read time. 
                                    </p>

                                        This sampling rate is much slower than the VL53L0X data sheet's 50Hz sampling rate. So the limiting factor is the Artemis, although I am uncertain why.
                                        Finally I created a method to send sensor data over bluetooth and plotted it using matplotlib.

                                            I chose to use pins A0 and A1 for the right motor, and A14 and A16 for the left motor. I mostly chose these pins 
                                            because I wanted the pins to be on the same side of the Artemis as the wheels they were driving. This made it easier to
                                            follow wires when I was having issues.

                                            Using a separate battery for the motor drivers and the Artemis prevents the Artemis from seeing jumps in current that the motor 
                                            drivers can cause for example when they start up.

                                            To test using the board, I set up the power supply with 3.7V and cycled the PMW value from 255 to 0 every 50ms. The oscilloscope 
                                            showed the board behaving as expected by generating a square wave, meaning the output was a constant value.

                                            Unfortunately I forgot to record the wheels spinning independently before fully assembling the components, but above is a video of the
                                            wheels spinning in both directions individually at the end. The code I used to do the original testing was very similar to what was used
                                            with the oscilliscope, but for the video I used a bluetooth command that sets all 4 pin values.

                                            But once I had tested that the motor drivers were connected properly I assembled
                                            everything onto the chasis. Not visible are the motor drivers which are under the tape that the Artemis sits on.

                                            To find the lowest PWM value that could drive the car, I set it on the ground and started with a value I was confident would work (100 for both forward pins)
                                            and decremented by 10, alternating between decreasing left and right. I ended up determining that the lowest I could drive with is 40 forward for both sides. 
                                            To find the minimum value to do an on axis turn, I started with left forward at 40 and right backward at 40, and did the same increment/decrement testing to
                                            find the balance of forward value = 2*backward value for ~90º turn.

                                            Unfortunately as I attempted to make it drive in a straight line I found that the minimum being the same for both was a coincidence, because to drive straight 
                                            the left motor needed a much higher value than the right. I began with 100 for both forward pins, to ensure it could cover the minimum 6 ft distance, and saw
                                            that the path was heavily leaning left, aka the right motor was spinning faster than the left. I guess and checked my way to a balance and settled on the right
                                            PMW being 0.6 * the left. The guess and check method provided some gems such as this
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            I found the values like this because I made a bluetooth command to update the PMW values, which made it very simple to continuously try new values. 
                                            The bluetooth command code is shown above with the demonstration of both wheels spinning. But below is the final video of the car driving straight 
                                            and the PMW values that I settled on for the test.

                                            For my open loop, I had the robot drive forward, do a spin, then reverses out of the spin.

                                        To implement the PID controller I added a bluetooth command that would set a flag, and in my main loop if 
                                        pid is set, then it calls the Foot() function which will attempt to get a reading and send motor inputs. I 
                                        also had a STOP command to interrupt the control and stop the robot and send data immediately. Those functions 
                                        are shown below.
                                    </p>

                                        I also added a record flag that will call a logging function every time the Foot() function is called. Once 
                                        the arrays were full or STOP was called it would send the stored data. This allowed me to have finer control 
                                        over what data I recorded as well as allowing me to run the controller as long as I wanted.

                                    <p>
                                        To implement this controller I started with a P controller. I decided that a kp gain of 10 would be good 
                                        because I am measuring distance in feet, so my max distance value is about 13 feet in long distance mode 
                                        (which the sensor is in), so a gain of 10 makes my P-value range from about -10 to 100, which gives easy 
                                        scaling for motor inputs by percentages. The else case is for linear extrapolation which is later but the 
                                        rest simply checks for a new sensor reading and updates current distance and error beliefs. 
                                    </p>
                                    <img class="col-lg-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/lab5/Screenshot 2024-03-29 at 11.30.14 PM.png" alt="..."/>

                                    <p>
                                        Since u = P and represents a percentage of error, it is easy to scale into a range of motor inputs. Since 
                                        my motors drive weaker backwards the range for those values is [140, 255] and forward it is [90, 255]. To 
                                        keep the bot straight I account for my right motor being stronger and give it 30% of that backwards and 50%
                                        forwards.
                                    </p>

                                        As you can see in the video the bot stops before it hits the wall (barely) and after some oscillation settles
                                        at about 1ft from the wall. As you can see though my sensor was starting to experience large semi-random spikes 
                                        in readings which made it very difficult to implement the integral and derivative part of the controller. Below 
                                        is a graph I got from holding the robot still for a few seconds, as you can see it occasionally reads very high. 
                                        Before the sensor started getting erraneous readings I had settled at kp=8, ki=3, kd=0.25. I used the data from 
                                        that run (below) to determine that the sensor readings were coming in about every 100ms. I then added the else 
                                        case from above so that the bot could estimate its position based on it's previous readings.

                                        Below is a video of the P controller running with the extrapolation functionality. I also have added the controller 
                                        output graph, the spikes correspond to the erroneous readings and the distance measurements are large enough that the 
                                        graph isn't usable. However I have a screenshot of the sent data and you can see it settles at just under a foot from 
                                        the wall.

                                        Initially started by having the PID function use the data stored in logging arrays, which allowed the 
                                        orientation to run for about 7 seconds. I then modified the arduino code so that it could run the controller
                                        and store and then send data for the 7 seconds without interrupting the control. I created a command to set a 
                                        flag to run the PID controller and in the main loop, if the flag was set it would call the function. This command 
                                        also decided the target angle for the bot to align itself with respect to its initial position. Similarly 
                                        there is a command and flag for recording data, and when the logs are full it sets another flag to start sending
                                        in each loop iteration instead of recording.

                                        I also added a stop command so that I could stop the robot at any point during its operation and send any data 
                                        it had recorded, and a command to change gain. Because of these, I could run the PID controller indefinitely while 
                                        collecting data and adjusting gains as needed, and pause anytime the robot got out of control.

                                        The ICM does have some drift as you can see in the graph above. Those measurements were taken with 
                                        the bot sitting still, so it does slightly drift positive. One way to accommodate this would be to use 
                                        the complimentary filter we created in lab2, but I found that the drift in this case is minimal enough 
                                        that it does not impact the goals of orienting the robot unless it is left to sit for several minutes. 
                                        Another limitation of the gyroscope is the rate at which it reads data, the maximum rate it can read a 
                                        change in degrees is 2000 per second, which I set it to ensure data is being gathered as quickly as possible.
                                        I did this by adding the below code to the setup section of the arduino sketch.
                                    </p>

                                        I started by implementing just a P controller. In my PID command I read in a goal angle, and make sure it
                                        is between 0 and 360. Then in the Pid control function, I assign my goal to be that angle distance from the 
                                        first measured angle. This helps mitigate the effect of drift from letting the bot sit before starting the 
                                        controller. This worked pretty easily sort of by chance. I selected 2 as my beginning Kp value arbitrarily 
                                        and it just so happened to be a good value.
                                    </p>

                                        The python code above sets the minimum PMW values to account for the difference in motor strength as 
                                        well as helping scale up the rate at which the robot turns. It then sets the gains so that only the P
                                        value is used, and sets the recording flag. As you can see in the video, this setup has the bot snap
                                        into orientation with little oscillation.

                                        I tried to add in I and D components, but both made the orientation worse in one way or another. The
                                        integral portion did technically make the orientation more accurate, but this resulted in the motor 
                                        stuttering a bit at the end of it's alignment to slightly tweak the angle, because the integral term 
                                        adds back some of the slop that I built in to my PID controller by allowing it to be +/- 5º of the 
                                        desired angle. The derivative term could have benefitted from some filtering as it made the output 
                                        oscillate a lot at the end. The end behavior with the derivative term involved was the bot rapidly
                                        switching the direction it was turning and "walking" forward instead of adjusting it's angle.

                                        An issue with using live sensor readings to control our robot is that we are limited by the data rate of our sensors. In particular
                                        the TOF sensors read rather slow and can significantly hinder precise control. Using a Kalman Filter to fill in the gaps of data
                                        should help make our control systems better.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        To build the model we need to account for as many forces as possible through the "drag" and "mass" we use. To do this I gathered data 
                                        by driving the bot at the wall at about 50% speed to record its terminal velocity. Below are the graphs of the readings.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I assumed the final velocity was approximately the terminal, so using that I determined that 90% of final velocity occurs at about 1.3 seconds. 
                                        Using this and the formulas from lecture above, I found m = -0.000155 and d = -0.000503. For the A and B matrices I also used the provided formulas,
                                        but for the C matrix I used [1, 0] because my distance is the positive distance from the wall, not negative. For covariance matrices, I set the measurement 
                                        sigma to 20mm, because that is approximately the error according to the TOF sensor documentation. I then set the other 2 to 100 so that the filter will favor 
                                        the read values.

                                        see that the filter follows the recorded values and you can see in the graph that it did just that while slightly overestimating. I use 1 as the u input because 
                                        I am at a constant input value to the motors. To see how well it predicts values the final addition in the while-loop condition and incrementing of t need to be 
                                        altered. As shown below the predicted values deviate to be much less than the measured value with each additional prediction made.

                                        I found that the issue appears to be the velocity of the state estimating model. It very rapidly approaches the terminal velocity and stays there, meaning 
                                        whenever it makes a prediction it is assuming the bot is moving at terminal velocity. Increasing sigma 2, the uncertainty of the velocity component of the state
                                        estimation, helps slightly as shown, but only resets the error when a new data point is taken.

                                        I chose to Implement the stunt by appending the two P controllers I made in the previous labs. To make them
                                        work together I had the distance controller run first and, once in the desired range, stop itself and start the 
                                        orientation controller by setting the icm flag. The commented out if clauses are from the original distance controller.
                                        Since I no longer need to settle at a distance, the behavior for overshooting was no longer necessary. I similarly 
                                        changed the end behavior of the orientation controller so that it would drive back towards the start position for  
                                        1.5 seconds once it completed its turn instead of just turning.

                                        This is the design that I ultimately went with, but I started encountering issues that hadn't been fully resolved
                                        during the distance control lab. My distance readings would semi-randomly spike into the millions or negative millions
                                        which made the control logic difficult. I came to find, after much difficulty, that the issue was with my extrapolation.
                                        It appears that my calculation for dt when deriving the slope was sometimes causing the slope to become infinite because of
                                        the speed of the loop. I am still not entirely sure why this occurred so sporadically, but to resolve this I added a 1ms delay
                                        after each run of the distance controller.

                                        Below are the videos of the code running successfully andthe data gathered from them. I was struggling to 
                                        get the robot to do a smooth drift and drive and settled on the behavior where it drifts into orienting, then drives.

                                        I chose to tackle this lab using the P controller built in the previous labs. The only modification
                                        that I made to the controller was what it's terminating conditions were. I had it attempt to take a reading
                                        at every angle and every time it reached a goal state it would pause until it gathered a measurement before 
                                        moving to the next one. The controller stopped when the angle calculations surpasses 370, I start the goal 
                                        at 0 and increment by 25, so there are always at least 14 measurements. I did two spinning readings in each
                                        location. Below you can see the changes to the goal state.
                                    </p>

                                        As you can see from the video it does mostly spin in place, and makes almost an exactly 360º turn.
                                        Becuase of that I believe it is very safe to approximate measurements for the robot staying still. As can 
                                        be seen in the code above I changed my goal by -25, I chose to do this because my motors spin better in 
                                        that direction, but it since numpy's to radians method handles negatives, it did not alter my transform
                                        matrices.
                                    </p>

                                        Above is the first spinning measurement taken for each part of the map. As is evident in some of the 
                                        maps, sometimes when the bot overshot the angle it would take a measurement and continue sending the
                                        wrong distance distpite the angle change. So for the translated graph I left out distance measurements
                                        that were the same as the one before them, this mostly cleaned up the issues. 
                                    </p>

                                        Below is the map I got with each spin, as well as where I believe the measurements indicate a wall. I chose
                                        these places for the walls because it is where there are the most data points located at/around. The top left 
                                        and bottom right of the area have large clusters that I don't believe are a wall because their color indicates
                                        they were taken from the opposite side of the map, nearing the end of the sensors range, and so I belive they 
                                        are erroneous readings.
